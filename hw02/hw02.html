        Court case and the denial of degree
    </h2>
    <pre>
Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external
examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali flied a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civli rights and that the
university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of
Appeals.[8]
